# SynchronizedScalaCollections

As Scala synchronized collections are deprecated and it the recommended replacements are Java's concurrent collections that have a different API and Java return types,
I thought it would be a good idea to provide Scala wrappers around these Java classes to provide an API with the most common Scala Collection API methods.
